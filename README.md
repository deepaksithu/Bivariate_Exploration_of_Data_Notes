## Overview
In these notes a data set of engine fuel economy data is analyzed using bivariate visualizations. The data set `fuel-econ.csv` contains information for 3,929 vehicles including make, model, transmission type, engine displacement, and miles per gallon. The `Bivariate Exploration.ipynb` file contains scatter plots, heat maps, violin plots, box plots, clustered bar charts, line plots, swarm plots, and rug and strip plots, and utilizes techniques such as transparency, jitter, and faceting using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` in conducting analysis of the data. The `Violin_and_Box_Plot_Practice.ipynb`, `Scatterplot_Practice.ipynb`, `Categorical_Plot_Practice.ipynb`, and `Additional_Plot_Practice.ipynb` files contain additional examples and practice of the visualizations.


## Requirements
This code depends on the following libraries:

1. `numpy`
2. `pandas`
3. `matplotlib.pyplot`
4. `seaborn`

In addition to these, the Jupyter Notebooks assume that the data set `fuel-econ.csv` has been extracted and is in the project folder.

The Binder badge above can be used to explore an executable environment for the `Bivariate Exploration.ipynb` file.

## Issues

- review notes
- rename files without spaces
- clean `Bivariate Exploration.ipynb` visualizations
